# tic-tac-toe

This is an implementation of the game Tic-Tac-Toe. The game allows users to input their own names and the gameplay alternates back and forth between the two players. Each players' number of wins is saved and updated on screen.

The purpose of this project is to become more familiar with factory functions and the module pattern in JavaScript and, of course, to further practice my HTML and CSS skills.
